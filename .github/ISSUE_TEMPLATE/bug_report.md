## `--bug-report`

<!--
    Since v0.12.0 poxy has a built-in option to generate a self-contained capture
    of your project's output using the --bug-report flag. If you are using v0.12.0
    or greater, it is expected that you will attach that file when submitting this
    report. Check the box [x] below when you have done so.
